# Yuriy Chamkoriyski Book-store project

> React & Redux app

![screenshot](./src/bookstore.png)

## Description

This project will lay foundations for my Bookstore website. I will create a React and Redux app. I will structure my files using the "feature folder" approach. I will also set up routing using React Router.

## Requirements:

### Phase 1, initialize project with components
- [x] Initialize React app.
- [x] Add React Redux (`npm install react-redux`).
- [x] Structure your application files using a "feature folder" approach and use the ducks pattern for your Redux files. Your files/folder structure could look like this:<br />
...<br />
/src<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|---/components<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|---/redux<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|--- /books<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| books.js<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|--- /categories<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| categories.js<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| configureStore.js<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| index.js<br />
- [x] The building blocks of your app should be set as re-usable components.
- [x] Add [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) and set two `<Route>`s and `<Link>`s for the app's navigation:
  - [x] Books - the default view
    - [x] Should display the list of books (empty at this point but it should be ready for the data) with the Remove button (no functionality yet).
    - [x] Should have a form for adding a book (no functionality yet).
  - [x] Categories
    - [x] Should display "Under construction" text only.
- [x] Styling is not required at this point.

### Phase 2, create and remove books
- [x] Configuring the Redux Store
- [x] Write book's actions and reducer
- [x] In the React component responsible for adding new books set the data inputs in the local React state (set title and author - NOTE: categories and comments are NOT part of this step). Once your new book object is ready to be submitted to Redux store, dispatch a corresponding action.
- [x] In the React component responsible for removing books - implement that event by dispatching a corresponding action.
- [x] Use the redux-logger to check if your application is working correctly - Open your browser's console and look for the logger messages. Upon every action dispatch, the logger will print:
  - [x] prev state - the state of the whole Redux store before the current action was dispatched.
  - [x] action - the action object that is being dispatched.
  - [x] next state - the state of the Redux store after the current action was dispatched.

### Phase 3, connect to API
- [x] Read the [Bookstore API documentation](https://www.notion.so/Bookstore-API-51ea269061f849118c65c0a53e88a739) to learn how to use the API.
- [x] Refactor your add book and remove book features to persist your changes in the server.
  - [x] You should refactor the redux code of your application using middleware to make async requests to the API.
  - [x] Don't do the changes using only React state.
- [x] Add book and remove book should work in the same way after the refactor.
- [x] No styling is required.

### Phase 4, styling
- [x] You will find all the details of the Bookstore design in [Zeplin](https://app.zeplin.io/project/5b35a9e13227086040f8eb75/screen/5b695e29bb8c844f118f9378).
- [x] Login to Zeplin (hint: you will find the credentials in the [sneak peek](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-react-redux/blob/main/bookstore/sneak_peek.md) of the project)
- [x] Open the project Bookstore CMS.
- [x] Use the information detailed in Zeplin to style the website.
- [x] Your final design should match Zeplin's design.
